* Zing currently uses an HTTP response class to buffer all output headers and then send
  them in one go.

* Various PHP functions (notably session_start()) output headers directly.
  If we use such functions we need to immediately undo their effect (via header_remove()),
  then stash the sent headers and later append them to the response object.
  
* Through output buffering and the various header_* functions, PHP already offers good
  functionality for managing response headers in a reliable way.
  
Idea:
-----

Rather than buffering header arrays in the Response's Headers object, the Response should
output all headers directly using header() and make use of PHP's own buffering facilities.
Modifications would be possible via a thin OO-wrapper around PHP's header_* fucntions.

Pros:
-----

 * No longer any need to work around PHP functions that output their own headers
 * Less functionality to be tested - PHP core can be assumed to work
 * Overall, less code

Cons:
-----

 * Less "pure" from an OO point of view; the Response class would essentially
   become a singleton and rely on global storage (i.e. PHP's header buffer)
 * Possibly impedes testability
 * Becomes possible to output headers from anywhere in the application
   (but surely this was already possible before, only it went undetected?)
