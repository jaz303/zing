For performance reasons errors are not rendered through the usual view subsystem
and are instead simply included() with output buffering. This means there are no
layouts, partials, helpers etc.

The following variables are available:

$request        User request, possibly modified by earlier controller
$exception      Exception which caused this error
$status         HTTP status code being returned

If you need more control over your errors, a custom handler can be created, even
on a per-environment basis. See $GLOBALS['_ZING']['zing.exception_handler'] in
config/app/main.php .
